Hey folks, I finally got my Sidewinder 3D Pro working on the SBLive
gameport. Here is what I did:

1.) Nothing worked under the 2.4.18 kernel source that came with redhat
7.3, so I got the 2.4.19 source from kernel.org

2.) compiling all the joystick-y stuff as modules and loading them all
after boot worked.

3.) compiling them all into the kernel did NOT work

4.) however, compiling all but the joystick driver into the kernel and
then installing the joystick driver in a boot time script did work. I
suspect that, because the SBLive port isn't a "standard" port, the
joystick driver has to be loaded after all the soundcard driver
initialization is done. So, this works.

If anyone else needs help, let me know.

1.) Compile kernel with:
	Gameport Joysticks [Y]
	Support for SBLive! Gameport [Y]

	Sidewinder [M]

modprobe sidewinder
