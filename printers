==== Brother HL-5250DN ====

Postscript driver recommended, but has issues. pxlmono also works, but
is much slower. I unstall both.

Has web interface.

Default creds are:

admin
access

I changed it to admin and our common password.

There is also a "user" account with the same password.

The printer needs to be directly installed on the Windows machine in
order for the firmware upgrade to work. It looks like it looks for
locally installed brother printers - it doesn't just probe the network
like Dell does.
