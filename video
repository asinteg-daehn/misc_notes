kdenlive dvdstyler

kdenlive - for video editing
dvdstyler - for menu creation and chaptering (kdenlive kind of sucks at this)

1. Add to video group:
sudo usermod -a -G video matt

2. dvgrab needs the -guid option to find the correct device because I
have multiple firewire ports. Pass it info as follows:

-guid 002011010100b160 
  ^ for Canopus ADVC 100


In kdenlive:
To render DVD files, choose "render" and render to DVD (easy enough)
Then you import these files into dvdstyler
