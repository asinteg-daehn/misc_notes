Create base dir (only once):

mkdir /home/matt/svn_repositories

(1) Create the repository:

cd /home/matt/svn_repositories
svnadmin create shiptool

(2) Import code into trunk (main bit repo)

svn import /home/matt/gaming/minis/full_thrust/programs/shiptool_orig \
   file:///home/matt/svn_repositories/shiptool/trunk \
   -m 'Initial import of shiptools'

(3) Check it out as normal. Note - you may have to remove the thing
you just imported and then check it out. Or, move it to a backup place
until you're sure it is okay.

svn checkout file:///home/matt/svn_repositories/shiptool/trunk \
    /home/matt/gaming/minis/full_thrust/programs/shiptool
