	(including visor stuff)
	NOTE: only do this AFTER all the patches are installed, so
	that you get the latest version, or just get it from kernel.org)
	
	CASE: Make sure to compile sidewinder as a module

19.) For joystick support, add 'modprobe sidewinder' in rc.local.

20.) for support for the i8k buttons, do a 'make', 'make install' as root and
	then copy the i8kbuttons script into /etc/init.d. Link it to where
	it should be.
