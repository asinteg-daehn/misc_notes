1.) Set stuff up (usb):
	Kernel (roll your own):
		USB Support
		Visor Support
		usbdevfs support
		usbdevfs must be mounted. The following line in /etc/fstab 
			should work:
		none	/proc/bus/usb	usbdevfs  defaults  0 0

	Kernel (from a vendor):
		modprobe usbcore*
		modprobe usbserial*
		modprobe visor

	* chances are, these are compiled in. After a fresh reboot, do
	  a dmesg | grep usb. If you see a bunch of usb.c and
	  usbserial.c messages, then they are compuled in.

If you have a serial cradle, no real setup is required, as the serial
driver is almost always in the kernel, and talking over it is done by
user-space programs.

2.) Configure apps. These are accessible through the Gnome Control
Center. However, since I do not use Gnome, I want to configure this
directly. 

gpilotd-control-applet 
	- configures gpilotd

gpilotd-control-applet --cap-id=1
	- configures conduits. I turned them all on. 

3.) gpilotd must be run before pushing hotsync button. If you use
gnome, this is done automatically (I think). I put it in my window
manager's startup script, but putting it in .Xsession or .Xclients
should work as well.

4.) How it works:
	gpilotd is watching the /proc/bus/usb filesystem, which has
info on connected USB devices. When the cradle button is pressed, the
cradle attaches to the USB bus, and the driver is loaded. gpilotd sees
this, and begins a syncronize operation, using the configured conduits
to determine what to do. Sweet, eh?

5.) Additional conduits:
	go to: http://www.eskil.org/gnome-pilot/
	I installed the new gnome-pilot-conduits, which adds time
syncronization, expense, memo, and sending mail conduits.

6.) As of right now, there does not appear to be a recieving mail
conduit for evolution. If anoyone knows of one, please let me know.
